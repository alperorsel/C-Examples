/*  
  After identifying the problem, how to combine the load cell and arduino for the project, was investigated. First of all, the Load cell is a highly sensitive device used 
  to measure weight or force in a number of different applications. They can be used to measure compression, pull, bending or shear forces.
In the later stages of the project, the codes of Arduino UNO were written. Then it was decided to use a yellow LED and a siren to alert the system. 

 I connected to the controller;
-Sounder to the 10th output,
-LED to the 9th output,
-HX711 to the 3rd output
